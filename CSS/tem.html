The great emperor rolls out a project of a land survey, reorganizing his kingdom into units known as valanadus. The local self-government gets revamped as he puts into place a foolproof audit system. The village assemblies and other public bodies are given autonomy.The colossal Brihadeeshwara Temple in Thanjavur, dedicated to Lord Shiva which is a glowing example of Dravidian architecture, comes up under his direction.

    He was the founder of the first historical Empire in India. He consolidated this huge Empire and perfected the machinery of Government. His Empire included Afghanistan, the Punjab, the United Provinces, Magadha (Bihar), the peninsula of Kathiawar and probably Bengal.
    He was the son and successor of Chandra Gupta I. On account of his great conquests he is known as the Indian Napoleon. He received homage and tribute even from the Deccan rulers. Many foreign kings entered into diplomatic relations with him. He was a man of versatile genius - a great warrior, an accomplished ruler, a musician, poet and scholar.He succeeded his father Samudra Gupta in 375 A.D. He was a renowned warrior and an accomplished prince. Chandra Gupta II drove away the foreigners form India. The Chinese traveler Fehien visited India in his time. Fabien says the country was rich and the people led a highly moral and honest life.The life and living conditions of the Cholas had always fascinated the people. The iconic king Raja Chola was the most powerful king in south India during his period of 985 CE -1014 CE. He is remembered for reinstating the Chola influence and ensuring its supremacy across the Indian Ocean. His empire stretched from as far as Sri Lanka in the south, and Kalinga (Orissa) in the northeast. He fought many battles with the Chalukyas in the north and the Pandyas in the south. Rajaraja laid the foundations for the Chalukya Chola dynasty.He was highly educated at court, trained in martial arts, and was no doubt instructed in the precepts of the Artashastra – even if he was not considered a candidate for the throne – simply as one of the royal sons. The Artashastra is a treatise covering many different subjects related to society but, primarily, is a manual on political science providing instruction on how to rule effectively. It is attributed to Chanakya, Chandragupta's prime minister, who chose and trained Chandragupta to become king. When Chandragupta abdicated in favor of Bindusara, the latter is said to have been trained in the Arthashastra and so, almost certainly, would have been his sons.<br><br>

    He was the younger son of Prabhakar Vardhana, the Raja of Thanesar. On the tragic murder of his elder brother, Harsha occupied the throne. He made great conquests. Harsha devoted himself to the task of peace and promotion of the moral and material interests of people. Harsha Vardhana was known for his scholarship, philanthropy and toleration. Hiuen Tsang or Yuan Chwang, a Chinese pilgrim, visited India during his reign.He was the son of Shahaji Bhonsale, a Maratha chieftain in the service of the Ahmadnagar State. He was a born leader of men, a great General, an able administrator. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj created a Hindu State in defiance of the Mughal Power, and unified the Maratha nation.
    He was the first Peshwa to become the de facto ruler. He was instrumental in the release of Sahu from the Mughal imprisonment and securing for him the throne of Satara. Balaji restored order in the Maratha kingdom and extended the Maratha influence. Balaji made the Maratha co-sharers of the Mughal revenue, and later the partners of the sovereignty as well. The whole of South India practically passed under the Maratha control.
