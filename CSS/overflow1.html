        <p>The early Pandyan dynasty went into obscurity during the invasion of the Kalabhras. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early sixth century. They pushed the Kalabhras out of the Tamil country and ruled from Madurai. They again went into decline with the rise of the Cholas in the ninth century and were in constant conflict with them. Pandyas allied themselves with the Sinhalese and the Cheras in harassing the Chola empire until they found an opportunity for reviving their fortunes during the late thirteenth century. During their history the Pandyas were repeatedly in conflict with the Pallavas, the Cholas, the Hoysalas, and finally the Muslim invaders from the Delhi Sultanate. Nonetheless, they also gave peace and stability to the southern plains of India for many centuries. In the end, they could not compete with the Muslim Delhi Sultanate as it pushed south, and lost power in the sixteenth century.</p>
