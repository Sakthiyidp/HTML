    Kanishka, also called Kanishka the Great, was one of the most extraordinary emperors of the Kushan Dynasty between 127-150 CE. He was the descendant of Kujula Kadphises, the empire founder of the Kushan dynasty. Kanishka is highly popular for his political, military, and spiritual achievements.

    <p>Samudragupta, after succeeding his father Chandragupta-I, became the second monarch of the majestic Gupta Dynasty. He was not only a determined conqueror and a great warrior; but was also an avid fan of various arts and cultures, especially poetry and music. Samudragupta is recognized as a generous ruler as he implemented different policies for the southern and the northern parts of India, which is why he is considered the greatest emperor of the Gupta Empire.</p>
