    <h1>Pandya Dynasty</h1>

    <p>Pandya dynasty, Tamil rulers in the extreme south of India of unknown antiquity (they are mentioned by Greek authors in the 4th century BCE). The Roman emperor Julian received an embassy from a Pandya about 361 CE. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early 7th century CE and ruled from Madura (now Madurai) or farther south until the 16th century. The small but important (9thâ€“13th century) dynasty of Pandya of Ucchangi, a hill fort south of the Tungabhadra River, may have originated from the Madura family</p>
