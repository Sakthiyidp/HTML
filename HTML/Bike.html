    <h3 style="background-color:orange;text-align:left;font-size:10pt">Bicycle, also called bike, two-wheeled steerable machine that is pedaled by the rider’s feet. On a standard bicycle the wheels are mounted in-line in a metal frame, with the front wheel held in a rotatable fork. The rider sits on a saddle and steers by leaning and turning handlebars that are attached to the fork. The feet turn pedals attached to cranks and a chainwheel. Power is transmitted by a loop of chain connecting the chainwheel to a sprocket on the rear wheel. Riding is easily mastered, and bikes can be ridden with little effort at 16–24 km (10–15 miles) per hour—about four to five times the pace of walking. The bicycle is the most efficient means yet devised to convert human energy into mobility.<button><a href="https://www.honda2wheelersindia.com/" target="_blank"> lets ride</a></button></h3><br>

    <h1 style="background-color:aqua">History of the bicycle</h1><br> <h3 style="background-color:green;text-align:right;font-size:25px"> Historians disagree about the invention of the bicycle, and many dates are challenged. It is most likely that no individual qualifies as the inventor and that the bicycle evolved through the efforts of many. Although Leonardo da Vinci was credited with having sketched a bicycle in 1492 in his Codex Atlanticus, the drawing was discovered to be a forgery added in the 1960s. Another presumed bicycle ancestor, the vélocifère, or célérifère, of the 1790s was a fast horse-drawn coach that is not considered to be a predecessor of the bicycle.<button><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_bicycle" target="_blank">No Fuel</h3></button>

    <h1 style="background-color:red">The modern bicycle</h1><br> <h3 style="background-color:orange;text-align:centre;font-size:125%"> It is not only a great alternative to gym workouts but also helps prevent cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, bicycles help to preserve our health. Similarly, they do not harm the environment. Moreover, they are also very beneficial as we can go through narrow roads with a bicycle which we cannot do with bikes or cars.<button style="height:40pt;width:80pt"></h3>

    <h1 style="background-color:pink">Benefits of e-bikes</h1><br> <h3 styl7:02 PM 09-Dec-22e="background-color:yellow;text-align:justify"> An electric bicycle (e-bike, eBike, etc.) is a motorized bicycle with an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion. Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, but they generally fall into two broad categories: bikes that assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e. pedelecs) and bikes that add a throttle, integrating moped-style functionality. Both retain the ability to be pedaled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and typically are motor-powered up to 25 to 32 km/h (16 to 20 mph). High-powered varieties can often travel more than 45 km/h (28 mph).<br><button><a href="https://www.bikewale.com/electric-bike" target="_blank">Acclerate Me</a></button></h3>
